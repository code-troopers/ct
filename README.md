CT : CLI Helper tool
==

This tool is a simple wrapper allowing to :

 * have aliases per project, aliases that can be called from whenever the project structure.
 * spawn a web GUI to get listening ports on your machine (http://localhost:1500)

Setup
==
You will need a few command line tools for this project to work :

 * bash
 * sed (gnu-sed for Mac users `brew install gnu-sed --default-names`
 * grep
 * dos2unix for Cygwin users

If you want to use the port list feature, you will also need :

 * lsof
 * curl
 * awk
 * netcat (nc)

Manual install
---
Clone the current repository or raw-download the `ct` shell script. Then put it in your path (typical location is ~/bin or /usr/local/bin).

Easy install
---
You can install the script by running the following commands in your shell (adapting the CT_TARGET value to a directory in your PATH):

     CT_TARGET=~/bin;mkdir $CT_TARGET; wget -O $CT_TARGET/ct https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-troopers/ct/master/ct && chmod +x $CT_TARGET/ct

Package install
---
If you use a debian based linux distribution, you can use the package. You may download a package when the first release is out.

Meanwhile, you can build the package yourself. Just run 

     debuild

The package will install a service if you have systemd, so you won't have to run `ct ports` (see below) just go to http://localhost:1500.

Port list usage
===
Simply run the command `ct ports` to get the list of listening ports on your machine at http://localhost:1500.
You will need a working internet connection to retreive the CSS/JS from the CDN to use it.
But you can easily imagine other frontends calling the URI http://localhost:1500/scan which returns JSON.

Aliaser feature usage
===

Configure a project
--
Create a `.ctproject` file at the root of your project structure, this file will contain the aliases you want to set for your current project.
It have to look like the following :

    # comments are ignored
    run='mvn clean install jetty:run'
    dbg='mvnDebug clean install jetty:run'
    test='mvn test'

Use it
--
Simply call `ct` followed by your alias to launch the command in your current directory. If you execute the command without specifying a command, help screen with the available commands will be printed.

Protip
--
Use consistent aliases in your `.ctproject` files, this way, you can define global aliases for your shell that will allow you to use consistent shortcut regardless of the project type you're on.

For example, you can add an alias `alias run="ct run"` and in each project define such a command. In your shell, a `run` will launch your project, no matter if the underlying task is a Maven or a Grunt one.
